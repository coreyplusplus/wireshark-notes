# Wireshark Intro Summary

## Key Takeaways

1. **Networks communicate via small units known as packets.**  
   Basically, data gets broken down and sent through these tiny chunks known as packets which Wireshark lets you see.

2. **Ping is used as a test to see if a device can reach another.**  
   It sends a message, better known as request, to a device and waits for a reply to confirm connectivity.

3. **Latency measures how fasts packets travel back and forth.**  
   A lower latency means packets travel faster, which in turn is a faster, smoother connection.

4. **Wireshark captures and displays all your network traffic in real time.**  
   It helps you look over what's happening on a network whilst it happens.

5. **Captured packets can be saved for analysis or other uses.**  
   Without saving, all captured packets disappear, and the data is lost.

## Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

- Understanding network traffic is necessary for spotting problems and attacks  
- Latency affects all online activites, e.g. how fast a security system could detect a threat. 
- Capturing packets is a required skill in cybersec., it allows you to investigate and defend networks effectively.
